Word problems are case insensitive by default, string problems are not. The questions do not allow for
advanced usage of parens - they may only be used for grouping.

In Q40-42, An Othello board is any string of length 64 made up of only the characters in &quot;xX.Oo&quot;. An
Othello edge is any string of length 8 made up of only the characters in &quot;xX.Oo&quot;.

---------------

Q40: Write a regular expression that will match on an Othello board represented as a string.


Q41: Given a string of length 8, determine whether it could represent an Othello edge with exactly one
hole.


Q42: Given an Othello edge as a string, determine whether there is a hole such that if X plays to the hole
(assuming it could), it will be connected to one of the corners through X tokens. Specifically, this means
that one of the ends must be a hole, or starting from an end there is a sequence of at least one x followed
immediately by a sequence (possibly empty) of o, immediately followed by a hole.


Q43: Match on all strings of odd length.


Q44: Match on all odd length binary strings starting with 0, and on even length binary strings starting
with 1.


Q45: Match all words having two adjacent vowels that differ.
   Test Cases:
               match: beard, toil, field, boar
               no match: hall, steer, boor, stale

Q46: Match on all binary strings which DON’T contain the substring 110.


Q47: Match on all non-empty strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} that contain at most one a.


Q48: Match on all non-empty strings over the alphabet {a, b, c} that contain an even number of a's.


Q49: Match on all positive, even, base 3 integer strings.
